TCB::mysql - DBIx::Frame interface to the mysql authorization database
======================================================================

TCB::mysql is a DBIx::Frame interface to the default mysql authorization
database that comes with MySQL.  It was written for easy tracking (though
not adding!) of information from this database within the Theoretical and
Computational Biophysics Group at UIUC, using the same interface as the
rest of the databases used there.  It provides a basic administrative
interface for adding, modifying, or deleting this information; it isn't
as full-featured as some of the scripts that come with the package, but it
still works pretty well.

Specific tables are described in the following modules:

  TCB::mysql::db	Database access
  TCB::mysql::host	Hostname access
  TCB::mysql::user	User access (with passwords)

Prerequisites
=============

You must have the following modules installed:

  DBIx::Frame		v1.06

You will also need a running MySQL database, and permission to either use
the existing contents or create new ones.

Installation Notes
==================

Installing this software is easy:

  perl Makefile.pl
  make
  make test
  make install

Database creation should not be necessary.

Documentation
=============

All of the documentation is in the manual pages - 'man TCB::mysql'
after installation, or 'pod2text TCB/mysql.pm | less' right now.
'perldoc TCB::mysql' probably also works.

Further information is available in the INSTALL file.
