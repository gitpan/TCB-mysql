Additional Installation Notes
=============================

General Notes
=============

Most of the scripts should be modified to match your local configuration.
It may be worthwhile to create a centralized set of authorization files,
to be used with the 'do' operations in each script, so that you can easily
modify usernames and passwords without later interfering with the actual
data.

Database Installation
=====================

You don't need to do any database installation with this pacakge; the
MySQL server should come with this database installed.

Web Installation
================

The following instructions assume a fairly basic Apache configuration; it
may not work with yours, but it has been known to work, and it's a good
start in setting up your own configuration.  Set up your files as so:

mysql-admin/		
  .htpasswd		Created with 'htpasswd'  
  .htgroup 		See sample htgroup-base
  .htaccess		See sample htaccess-base
  index.cgi		Copied or linked from cgi-bin/mysql_admin.cgi
  stylesheet.css	Copied or linked from cgi-bin/stylesheet.css

Note that *most* of these files are not installed into any directory
structure by default, due to limitations on Perl's Makefile.PL system.
